<h1>Welcome to Squonk Labs</h1>
<p>Squonk labs is where we experiment with things prior to inclusion in the Squonk Computational notebook.
    This includes new features and enhancements to existing features.
    It gives users a chance to see what's coming and to provide input into how things should work.
</p>
<p>These pages are usually simple HTML/Javascript pages free of any of the Computational Notebook infrastructure.
This provides a simpler and faster developement environment, but the aim is to do this in a way that allows the components
(usually just JavaScript and CSS) to to dropped into the Computational Notebook with no, or only minmal, changes.</p>
<p>Currently in Squonk labs are:</p>
